<h1>Some thoughts on low cost, solid state,&nbsp;efficient,
kilowatt-class HF linear amplifiers</h1>




</center>




<p> For several years I have been thinking about ways to build a
solid state legal-limit amplifier for&nbsp;amateur radio use. It's
not that I would absolutely need one! I own an old National Radio
NCL-2000 tube-type amplifier, that still works very well.
But&nbsp;out of technical interest I would like to develop a solid
state amplifier. This new amplifer <strong>must</strong>
have at least one technical advantage over plain simple common
traditional amplifiers: Either it must be ultra low cost along with
respectable performance, or it might be extremely small and
lightweight, extremely efficient, or anything else like that. It should
be an <strong>interesting</strong> amplifier, not just a
brute force tool to get high RF power. And it <strong>must</strong>
meet some basic requirements: The cost shall be low enough in any case
to make the project worthwhile; it must provide&nbsp;enough
spectral quality to not be a nuisance to other hams, and it must
operate either in complete silence, or with very low noise. I'm fed up
with the loud whirring&nbsp;blower of the NCL-2000!</p>




<p> I'm writing this page for three purposes: To bring some order
and organization into my&nbsp;ideas; to&nbsp;allow others to
eavesdrop into my work and maybe get a good idea or two from it; and
mainly to try and start an intelligent discussion on this matter. I
warmly welcome contributions! This article contains many assumptions I
made, based on my incomplete knowledge of the
many quirks of MOSFETs,&nbsp;so if you find mistakes and/or
you have good ideas, please let me know! My e-mail address

<!--[endif]--> I wrote this in november 2010, so if you
happen to read it sometime in the 22nd century, forgive me for being
out of date.&nbsp;</p>




<h2> Basic design concepts</h2>




<p> I was considering several totally different basic ideas to
build an amplifier:</p>




<p> - A conventional class AB push pull amplifier, whose special
features lie basically in using high voltage MOSFETs and operating
directly from the rectified and filtered mains voltage. If reasonably
low cost MOSFETs are used, this would lead to a compact, very
lightweight, low cost amplifier, having a slightly better efficiency
than those using power supplies that convert the voltage. The
MOSFETs&nbsp;could be something like the ARF1505, or perhaps some
low cost switching type pressed into this service.</p>




<p> - Conventional class AB push pull amplifier, operating from a
switching power supply that is modulated to keep the voltage just a
little above the RF voltage produced. This would be relatively simple
and inexpensive, and would offer reasonably small size and low weight
along with somewhat better efficiency than standard class AB
amplifiers. The active devices could be ARF1500, IXZ210N50L, or
perhaps&nbsp;common low cost switching MOSFETs pressed into linear
RF service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>




<p> -&nbsp;Water cooling: It's an advantage to be able to run
a MOSFET at the highest possible power, because that reduces the number
of devices, and thus the capacitances, complexity and cost. This
requires the best possible cooling. Water cooling should allow running
a MOSFET at higher power than with conventional heatsink-and-fan
cooling. It would also essentially&nbsp;eliminate noise. For
non-intensive use, the heat could simply be discharged into a bucket of
water sitting under the operating desk! The only noise would be that
from a tiny water pump.</p>




<p> - Class E or class F amplifier using envelope elimination and
restoration: This would not be the simplest approach, but it would lead
to a highly efficient, small, lightweight, silent&nbsp;amplifier,
at reasonable cost. The MOSFETs could be RF switching types, of which
Ixys has some nice ones.&nbsp;I actually built a scaled-down
prototype, but ran into trouble. More about that comes further down
this page.</p>




<p> - Pulse-width-modulated switching-type amplifier. This is my
latest pet idea. The pulse frequency is the RF frequency, the phase
information would be carried by the pulse position, and the amplitude
information by the pulse width. It requires really fast switching
MOSFETs and drivers, but could lead to a low cost, highly efficient
amplifier. This concept can use an unregulated power supply having only
mediocre filtering, without significant disadvantage.</p>




<hr>
<p>Before starting with the main article, I would like to draw
your attention toward&nbsp;one item first, that is often
misunderstood:</p>




<h2>Output architectures of conventional class AB push-pull
amplifiers</h2>




<p>&nbsp;This technology is very well established, to the
point that many designers simply copy standard layouts and optimize the
component values, instead of coming up with new ideas. This leads to
copying the mistakes as well as the good ideas! One of these mistakes
is the incorrect understanding and use of the typical
push-pull&nbsp;output transformer, the kind that is wound on a
two-hole ferrite core, on two ferrite tubes, or on two stacks of
ferrite toroids placed side-by-side.&nbsp;I will explain this, and
I would like to read your comments on this matter, if you have any!</p>




<p>This is the basic layout of the output circuit of a
typical&nbsp;push pull class AB amplifier:&nbsp;</p>




<p align="center"><img src="./Some thoughts on low cost, solid state, kilowatt-class HF linear amplifiers_files/fig1.gif" border="0" height="127" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="184">
</p>




<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with this circuit. It works
like this: When there is no drive, the transistors are biased to the
brink of conduction, and the voltage on all three terminals of the
transformer primary winding is Vcc. When drive starts, during one
semicycle Q1 conducts a current, while Q2 is off. The current flows
from the power supply through the upper half of the primary winding and
through Q1 to ground. This current starts small,&nbsp;increases to
a peak, and gets small again. At the same&nbsp;time, the voltage on
the primary winding's upper terminal gets pulled down from the Vcc
value. Due to coupling between turns, the voltage on the lower
terminal, and thus on Q2's drain, goes higher than Vcc. When the
amplifier is being driven just to the limit of its linear capability,
the voltage on Q1's drain will reach a value very close to zero (this
is the saturation voltage for that transistor), while the voltage on
Q2's drain will go up from Vcc by the same amount as Q1's drain went
down, reaching almost twice Vcc. The voltage on the output terminal
will be proportional to that on the primary winding, with the voltage
ratio given by the turns ratio. The current flowing in the secondary
winding will depend on this voltage, and on the load connected. The
current in Q1 will depend on this secondary current and on the turns
ratio, while Q2 will conduct no current.</p>




<p>To put numbers to all this, let's assume the case of a 100
Watt amplifier powered by 13.8V, like those used in typical HF
transceivers. Even if most of them use bipolar transistors rather than
MOSFETs, the output circuit won't be different. The turns ratio in such
an amplifier will be 1:4 between the entire primary and the secondary
windings. When operating at 100 watts into a 50 ohm load
resistance,&nbsp;at the waveform peak Q1's drain will be at 1.3V,
and Q2's drain will be at 26.3V. This makes 25V across the primary. The
1:4 transformer raises this to 100V.&nbsp;On a 50 Ohm load, this
makes a secondary peak current of 2A. Since the lower half of the
primary winding cannot conduct any current, given that Q2&nbsp;is
not conducting, all of the primary current has to flow in&nbsp;the
upper half.&nbsp;So we have a turns ratio of 1:8 there, meaning
that the peak current flowing through Q1 will be 16A.</p>




<p>On the next half cycle, of course, the roles of Q1 and Q2
reverse, but the math remains the same.</p>




<p>Under these conditions, the 50 Ohm load sees a peak voltage of
100V, peak-to-peak voltage of 200V, and an RMS voltage of 70.71V, which
produces 100W output power into that load. At the same time, the DC
current consumed from the power supply is the average of the sine
waveform ( <strong>not</strong> the RMS value!), which
is&nbsp;2/PI times the peak value. That is 10.186A in this case, so
that the input power to this amplifier is 140.6W.&nbsp;Thus the
efficiency of this stage is 71%.</p>




<p>If you have any experience working with radio,&nbsp;you
will know that real world solid state broadband linear amplifiers are
hardly ever as efficient as this. Efficiency is often stated as only
45%! &nbsp;This needs at least two explanations:</p>




<p>Firstly, the math I did above does not consider all
losses.&nbsp;The
only loss I considered is the one that happens due to transistor
saturation being well above zero volts. But in practice there are
additional losses in the transformer, feedback circuits, and also there
is a small but nonzero bias current flowing, to make the stage work in
class AB rather than pure class B, which wouldn't provide enough
linearity. In addition, the user wants to see 100 watts at the
radio's&nbsp;antenna terminal, so the amplifier has to deliver a
few
additional watts to cover losses in the low pass filter and sensing
circuitry. For all these reasons, it would be reasonable to get only
about 65% efficiency instead of 71%, but many practical implementations
fall far short from this goal! Interestingly, many tube type linear
amplifiers do&nbsp;have about 65% efficiency. It's not that tubes
are
better than transistors, nor that tuned circuits must deliver better
efficiency than broadband ones.&nbsp;The reasons are others.</p>




<p>Part of this discrepancy can be explained by data sheets
sometimes stating the efficiency of linear amplifier stages based on a
two-tone signal, not a single tone like I assumed&nbsp;above. A
two-tone signal gives a waveform that spends much more time at the
lower voltage levels, in which a larger proportion of Vcc is dissipated
in the transistors rather than being applied to the output transformer.
So it's normal that the two-tone efficiency is much lower than the
single-tone one. But the problem is that many practical amplifier
stages used in actual radios show a lower than normal efficiency even
in single-tone&nbsp;testing! The final stage of my 100 watt
radio&nbsp;draws between 14 and 17A when delivering 100W, depending
on the band. The complete radio draws up to 21A.&nbsp;That's a
single-tone efficiency for the final stage between 52% and 43%! It's
much too low, compared to the theoretical values for class B or AB
amplifiers, and there must be a reason for this.</p>




<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="./Some thoughts on low cost, solid state, kilowatt-class HF linear amplifiers_files/transformer.jpg" align="left" border="0" height="421" hspace="8" vspace="8" width="358">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>




<p>This photo, taken from the ARRL Handbook, shows the typical
way the output transformers for such amplifiers are built. The 1-turn
primary is made from pieces of metal tubing inserted in the cores,
joined at one end by a piece of PCB to form a full turn.&nbsp;It
becomes immediately apparent that this device <strong>cannot</strong>
be correctly represented as shown in the schematic above! This device
can be&nbsp;considered a single transformer <strong>only</strong>
if the "center tap" (which&nbsp;isn't a true center tap at all!) of
the primary winding isn't used! This is because&nbsp;it
has&nbsp;<strong>two independent</strong> magnetic
cores. The magnetic flux created by each of the metal tubes flows ONLY
in the ferrite tube that covers it, and <strong>not</strong>
in its neighbor. If the "center tap"&nbsp;isn't used, the two metal
tubes are always in series, always see the same current, and so it
doesn't matter whether the transformer has a single core, or two cores.
But if the metal tubes can take different currents, such as happens
when the "center tap" is used, then the two ferrite tubes can have
totally different flux in them, effectively forming two separate
transformers, with their <strong>secondaries</strong>
connected in series without a tap at the connection, and the primaries
connected in series <strong>with </strong>a tap!</p>




<p>It should be noted that the common practice of using a single
ferrite core that has two holes doesn't change anything of this. Even
if the ferrite is a single chunk instead of two separate chunks, the
magnetic circuits around the two holes are still independent.</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>To make it clearer, this is the true schematic representation
of a push-pull amplifier using this output transformer:</p>




<p align="center"><img src="./Some thoughts on low cost, solid state, kilowatt-class HF linear amplifiers_files/fig2.gif" border="0" height="200" hspace="8" vspace="8" width="249">
</p>




<p>Since this drawing looks too much like a dish of noodles, we
can use a simplified equivalent instead:</p>




<p align="center"><img src="./Some thoughts on low cost, solid state, kilowatt-class HF linear amplifiers_files/fig3.gif" border="0" height="160" hspace="8" vspace="8" width="206">
</p>




<p>The important fact is that the two cores are separate, and
this has serious implications on the way the circuit works.</p>




<p> Repeating the same analysis made for the circuit in figure 1,
we get a surprise: When Q1 is starting to conduct when we just apply
drive, it's pulling low the upper side of the primary winding
on&nbsp;T1a.&nbsp;This makes&nbsp; a voltage appear on
T1a's secondary, with the negative side up. This tries to make a
current flow in the load, and thus also in the secondary of T1b, since
they are all in series. But T1b's secondary cannot conduct a current
now, because Q2 is off and so there is no place the corresponding
primary current could go! An ideal transformer cannot have the current
in one winding change, without the corresponding opposed change in
current in its other winding. And we want T1 to be pretty close to
ideal, right?</p>




<p> What happens then is that there flows no current in the
load,&nbsp;and the full voltage developed on the secondary of T1a
appears on the secondary of T1b, with the positive side up. So a
corresponding smaller voltage appears on T1b's primary, also with the
positive side up. That means,&nbsp;Q1 pulling its drain down from
Vcc will also pull down the voltage on Q2's drain, by the same amount!
The voltage on Q2's drain should go&nbsp;<strong>up</strong>
in this situation, if the push-pull circuit were working correctly, but
instead it's going <strong>down</strong>! No significant
output appears across the load, but there is some net DC voltage across
the transformers' primaries, which slowly starts building up a DC
current in the two primaries.</p>




So&nbsp;it's clear that this amplifier configuration <span style="font-weight: bold;">cannot respond to fast changes in
the amplitude of the RF signal!</span>
&nbsp;It can only
respond to any form of amplitude modulation as long as the highest
frequency component of the envelope is of a frequency low enough that
the transformers have no significant impedance there. Instead the
correctly configured circuit, with a properly coupled output
transformer, is free from this problem. For SSB transmission on HF
this&nbsp;point is irrelevant, but not in some other applications of
broadband amplifiers.<br>




<br>




Now let's see what happens under steady-state conditions, while
amplifying a continuous unmodulated carrier: In this condition, a
suitable direct current will have been set up in each primary, over the
course of many RF cycles.&nbsp; While Q1 is in its active range, it
tries to conduct a half-wave sine of current, while T1a tries to keep
the total current in it (primary current plus secondary current, each
multiplied by the number of turns of each winding) to stay constant.
The result is that the secondary has to conduct a half sine current
too, which seems fine! &nbsp;But there is a problem: T1a's
secondary is in series with T1b's. And T1b acts just like T1a, only
that Q2 isn't conducting at this time! So, there is no primary current
in T1b, which means that its secondary winding must carry the whole
transformer current - and that's a constant current, instead of a half
sine shaped current! <br>




<br>



This cannot work well!<br clear="all">



<br>



<img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 443px; height: 296px; float: right;" alt="" src="./Some thoughts on low cost, solid state, kilowatt-class HF linear amplifiers_files/ampWrongNoFB.png" hspace="8" vspace="3">If
the transformers behave reasonably close to perfect transformers, then
T1b will inevitably win, and the current through the load will be
essentially constant during each half cycle, so that the total load
current approaches a square wave instead of a sine wave. But this still
doesn't&nbsp;completely explain how this amplifier can work, because
while T1b tries to force a continuous current in the secondaries while
Q2 is off, Q1 is being driven with a half sine wave, so that at first
it can conduct only a small current, then more, then more than needed,
then less again, and then too little. As a result, Q1 will saturate
over a part of the cycle, even when the amplifier is driven at a level
far lower than its maximum. And close to the zero crossings of the sine
drive signal, the drain voltages - for both transistors - will soar to
very high levels, because neither of the two transistors can conduct
the current that the transformers are forcing into that circuit, nor is
there any alternative path to ground!<br>



<br>



The image shown here is for a simulated amplifier running from 12V,
with a 1:1output transformer configured the wrong way, and a 20&#8486;
load.&nbsp; The red curve is the drain voltage of Q1, while the green
curve is the voltage across the load. Note that the peak drain voltage
is high enough to make 12V RF transistors enter avalanche breakdown, or
even burn them out!<br clear="all">



<br>



<img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 442px; height: 296px; float: left;" alt="" src="./Some thoughts on low cost, solid state, kilowatt-class HF linear amplifiers_files/ampWrongWithFB.png" hspace="8" vspace="3">These
high voltage peaks can be brought under control by several methods. One
is applying negative feedback from the drains to the gates. This forces
both transistors to conduct a higher current when the drain voltages
rise too much around the zero crossings, having roughly the same effect
as a dynamic bias that lifts the quiescent current during those zero
crossings. In effect this moves the operating point of the amplifier
somewhat closer to class A, with its efficiency penalty. <br>



<br>



As the image shows, the high and dangerous voltage peaks are gone now,
but the waveforms don't really look better! This is definitely not what
you would expect to see in a&nbsp;linear push pull amplifier, right?<br clear="all">



<br>



<img style="width: 450px; height: 338px; float: right;" alt="" src="./Some thoughts on low cost, solid state, kilowatt-class HF linear amplifiers_files/TS50Collector.jpg" hspace="8" vspace="3">If
you don't believe my simulations, get any of the many
current&nbsp;transceivers that use this wrong&nbsp;
configuration,&nbsp;get a scope too, and have a look at the drain
voltage waveforms! You will see that they correspond rather well with
this simulation. <br>



<br>



This screenshot is of my scope, hooked to one of the collectors in the
final stage of my Kenwood TS-50 transceiver, running at 50W on the 20m
band. The radio's&nbsp;capacitive-input low-pass filter, and my 50MHz
bandwidth scope, smooth all the corners related to&nbsp;high harmonics
in the waveform, but the very fundamental effect of the positive tip of
the sinewave being&nbsp;reversed is blatantly obvious!&nbsp; <br clear="all">



<br>



Using strong drain-gate feedback incurs in a significant power loss in
the necessary resistors. For this reason, many amplifiers (both with
the correct and the wrong configuration) use a differential negative
feedback taken from a down-transformed sample of the output. This is
effective on the output waveform but not on the common-mode drain
voltages. The designers of these&nbsp;amplifiers see themselves forced
to implement some patches to keep the peak drain voltages under
control. Typically these take the form of a large choke in series with
the power supply, without a bypass capacitor at the false center point,
but with a hefty low value resistor in parallel with the choke!
&nbsp;This works, but is very lossy too. Also some designers love to
slap rather capacitors in parallel with the transistors, more than
required for compensation of stray inductances. These capacitors tend
to provide at least some path to ground for the harmonics, specially
the higher ones, reducing the peak voltage level in the higher
frequency region. Also often very marginal transformer inductance is
used, which tends to reduce the amplitude&nbsp; of these peaks in the
lower frequency range. <br>



<br>



The combination of such lossy patches, and the "forced near class-A"
operation of this amplifier configuration, explain the low efficiency
obtained.<br>



<br>



Note that my test amplifier wasn't using any low pass filter. After a
low pass filter of course there will be a clean sine wave, but the
efficiency will become even lower, and the bad waveforms in the
amplifier will remain!<br>



<br>



When I built my very first&nbsp;broadband push-pull
amplifier, at age 14, I didn't yet understand these matters. I got
barely 30% efficiency, very poor gain, and burned out several
transistors. I added zener diodes to clip the high voltage&nbsp;pulses,
until deciding that the design I was copying from a book had a
serious flaw. I couldn't find out then which flaw it was. I built a
different amplifier, a tuned one, and that had better than 60%
efficiency, using the same transistors, and never failed in over 30
years since it was built.
<p>Note that if the transistors were deliberately biased into class A,
this
circuit would work fine! In class A, each of the two transistors would
conduct during the entire RF cycle, only in opposite phase. Each of the
two transformers&nbsp;would see a complete sine wave with a
superimposed DC component on its primary side, and a pure sine wave on
the secondary side. The DC component is usually irrelevant in RF
transformers, because it's no larger than the RF component, and RF flux
density has to be kept very low anyway to avoid excessive loss in the
core, so that the resulting low DC flux density is very far from
causing saturation. So, the circuit with the two separate transformer
cores works well in class A, and some designers indeed have found that
they have to bias their amplifiers well into class A to get them to
work, and to keep the peak drain voltage inside a safe range. The usual
symptom is poor&nbsp;gain and dismal efficiency in class B, with
normal behavior in class A. Biased into class AB, the amplifiers will
have good performance up to the power level where the operation moves
from
class A mostly into class B, and there the gain will&nbsp;drop, the
waveform will distort, and high drain voltage peaks will appear. This
change of gain, when transitioning from class A operation into class
AB, also explains the poorer IMD performance of the wrongly configured
amplifiers, when compared to a correct configuration.</p>



If the output transformer is built on one single core, having
one single magnetic loop, such as a toroid, of course the circuit will
work fine in class AB and class B too. And if the transformer is built
from two separate cores, like the one in the photo, but the primary
winding has <strong>two</strong> turns, with one complete
turn&nbsp;on&nbsp;each side of the center tap, then it will
work fine too in class AB or class B! But many circuit designers (or
should I rather say "circuit copiers"?) seem to love the conventional
construction style of this transformer, and copy it without hesitation
nor any understanding of its behavior.
<p>Not all is lost. It's possible, and has actually been quite usual
in&nbsp;real world radios for many years, to make a small&nbsp;addition to
this circuit, that will solve the problem:</p>




<p align="center"><img src="./Some thoughts on low cost, solid state, kilowatt-class HF linear amplifiers_files/fig4.gif" border="0" height="159" hspace="8" vspace="8" width="256">
</p>




<p>T2 is a relatively small ferrite toroid, on which a few
bifiliar turns are wound. This is connected as&nbsp;a
center-tapped&nbsp;choke, with its two sides being very tightly
coupled, thanks to the bifiliar winding style. The amplifier is fed
through this device, instead of using the incorrectly implemented
"center tap" of&nbsp;T1. T2 is often considered to be just
a&nbsp;DC feed choke in the literature, and many authors who have
never tought about this matter consider it completely optional, but in
fact in a circuit like this it's not optional at all, and its true role
is quite a bit more involved! </p>




<p>Let's analize what happens:&nbsp;When Q1 conducts at the
peak of its semicycle, it will have 1.3V on its drain, making 12.5V
between Vcc and its drain. That places 12.5V on one half of T2. Due to
the tight coupling, that forces 25V to appear across the entire T2,
making Q2's drain go up to 26.3V. The primaries&nbsp;of T1 will see
a total of 25V, that will be transformed to 100V at the output,
and&nbsp;the 50 ohm load will take a current of 2A. Since both
primaries of T1 are conducting, we have a true 1:4 turns ratio, so the
primary current is 8A. These 8A come from the power supply, flow
through the lower half of T2, then through the primaries of T1 and from
there through Q1 to ground. Since T2 is tightly coupled, the current
through its lower half is compensated for by another equal current,
another 8A, flowing from the power supply through the upper half of T2,
also through Q1 and to ground.</p>




<p>So we have the same current and voltage in the transistors and
power supply as in the analysis for figure 1, and also the same power
output and efficiency. The only practical effect of adding T2 is that
we can now use a T1 built like the transformer in the photo, without
any&nbsp;problems! In other words, T2 simply provides the true
center tap that&nbsp;cannot exist on a transformer that uses two
cores and only one primary turn!</p>




<p>In this circuit it's a good idea to place a DC blocking
capacitor in series with T1's primaries. If everything were perfectly
balanced, that capacitor wouldn't be necessary, but things are hardly
ever really well balanced. Even a small net DC could saturate T2, since
this choke is usually wound with several turns on a small core.</p>



<p><img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 441px; height: 297px; float: right;" alt="" src="./Some thoughts on low cost, solid state, kilowatt-class HF linear amplifiers_files/ampCorrectNoFB.png" hspace="8" vspace="3">Do
you want to see what difference this bifiliar feed choke makes?
&nbsp;Well, just look at this image! It's the exact same test amplifier
that produced the horrible waveforms above, with the same drive, the
same bias - but with a bifiliar feed choke added. <br>



</p>



Much better, right? &nbsp;This are the waveforms one would expect: The
output is a reasonably clean sine wave, and the drain waveform is also
a reasonably clean sine wave, centered on the supply voltage.<br>



<br>



The exact same results are obtained without the bifiliar choke, using
the output transformer's center tap, as long as the&nbsp;transformer
has correct coupling between both halves of the primary. That is, if
the transformer has one single magnetic loop, or if the primary
consists of at least two turns, that is, at least one complete turn for
each side of the primary, through all magnetic loops the core has.<br>



&nbsp;<br>



Note that this image shows the results without any negative feedback! <br clear="all">



<p><img style="border: 1px solid ; width: 440px; height: 297px; float: left;" alt="" src="./Some thoughts on low cost, solid state, kilowatt-class HF linear amplifiers_files/ampCorrectWithFB.png" hspace="8" vspace="3">We
can of course add negative feedback to this circuit too. The result is
lower gain and better linearity, but without any fundamental effect on
the circuit's operation.</p>



<p> By the way, when you have more drive power available than&nbsp;you
need to drive your transistors, the most stupid thing you could do is
wasting that power in an attenuator! Instead it's much better to reduce
the amplifier's gain by increasing its negative feedback, because that
will make good use of the excess drive power to improve the linearity
of the amplifier! &nbsp;After all, in a Linear Amplifier you can never
have too much linearity...<br clear="all">



</p>





<p>The technical literature contains a great&nbsp;many
examples of schematics that contain the output transformer error
addressed here. Authors
copy from each other, without ever actually building the circuit and
testing it. So they don't notice the mistake. Or they actually build
the circuits, and consider themselves satisfied with 50% efficiency in
class B, failing to understand that with a correct circuit
configuration they could easily get 65% or better, and improved
linearity too.</p>



<p>And now that I have blown off enough steam on this issue, let's go on to the
main part of this article!</p>




<hr>
<h2>MOSFETs for high power class AB linear amplifiers</h2>




<p>If we want to build a high power HF amplifier, the selection
of suitable transistors isn't very broad. Some jokers suggest to use
the MRF154 or MRF157. At close to 1000 dollars a pair, they just can't
be a popular choice. Many people prefer the MRF150 or similar ones,
which are much smaller and equally old fashioned. Typically four pairs
of these would be required, as a minimum. That makes for an
increasingly complex amplifier.</p>




<p> &nbsp;But there are other options. Quite recently a few
other manufacturers have come out with relatively high power MOSFETs
rated for linear amplifier service at frequencies to 30MHz and beyond.
The ARF1500 series, and the IxysRF devices, are good examples. These
transistors are less expensive than the venerable and rather antique
Motorola/Macom ones, but still their cost is significant. A typical ham
building an amplifier will inevitably worry about burning out a set or
two of transistors, before curing any infant maladies of his pet
project. If the transistors cost a few bucks, that's no problem. But if
each little cloud of smoke you draw costs you 2000 dollars for a quad
of MRF154 transistors, it might make&nbsp;you think twice, at
least, before embarking on the project! It doesn't make <strong>me</strong>
think twice, anyway: That price is too high, period! It doesn't even
deserve a second thought.</p>




<p>I have intensely thought about the IxysRF transistors, such as
the IXZ210N50L. They have lots of things in their favor: They were
designed specifically for linear amplifier use. Their power
capabilities would allow making a legal-limit amplifier with reasonably
few devices. Their physical shape lends itself well to simple
construction with low stray reactances. And their cost, according to
advertised&nbsp;&nbsp;prices, might be no more than 300 dollars
for a full set that&nbsp;produces 1500W output. I have only two
hassles with them:&nbsp;One is that they seem pretty unique, so
that if IxysRF decides to pull them, there would be no way in the world
for anyone to copy my design, nor for me to repair it, should the
transistors ever fail. And the other is that these devices seem to be
mostly vaporware! I haven't been able to find any distributor who would
actually be able and willing to sell me a few. I wonder if these
transistors are actually in production, or if they are some sort of
phantom.</p>




<p>The ARF devices look worthwhile too, but they too are not easy
to find, and they are more expensive. Also their characteristics seem
to be a little less attractive than the Ixys ones, for example they
have higher capacitances for a given set of conditions.</p>




<p>I have spent lots of time thinking about the use of plain
common power switching MOSFETs for high power linear amplifier use.
These are widely available, in countless different specs and shapes and
colors and flavors, and they are very inexpensive. New and better ones
show up all the time. Many hams have&nbsp;successfully used small
switching MOSFETs like the IRF510 for linear RF
amplification.&nbsp;So one might be tempted to investigate the
differences between linear RF MOSFETs, and switching MOSFETs.</p>




<p>The differences are in fact many. Some of them are related to
the "RF" factor, and others are related to the "linear" factor. Let's
see:</p>




<p>Switching MOSFETs are optimized to have the lowest possible
resistance when on, and the highest possible one when off. And they
should go from off to on, and back, as quickly as possible. That's
about all there is to it. Linear RF MOSFETs instead don't need to have
very low ON resistance, because they will operate in their linear
range, not in saturation, and a lower ON resistance would only
marginally increase their efficiency. Instead they need to have the
absolutely lowest possible internal capacitances, because these are
always too high in MOSFETs and cause lots of trouble when operating at
RF. So switching MOSFETs will have a dense gate structure, while RF
MOSFETs will have a more open one.</p>




<p>RF MOSFETs don't need to switch quickly, and it's not even
desirable for them to do so! It's better to be able to slowly and
smoothly control the current. For that reason RF MOSFETs have much
lower transconductance than switching ones. This is a side effect of
the lower gate density too, so it goes hand-in-hand with lower
capacitances.</p>




<p>It lies in the nature of MOSFETs&nbsp;&nbsp;that their
ON resistance has a positive temperature coefficient. If two MOSFET are
in parallel, and one happens to take more current than the other, it
will raise its resistance and offset that effect. This has given rise
to the fame that MOSFETs can be paralleled without any current sharing
devices. For the same reason, the current tends to distribute evenly
over the surface of a MOSFET chip. Some people forget, though, that
this mechanism of current distribution works only while the MOSFET is
in ON state, that is, in saturation! It does not work while the
transistor is in its linear range, be it because it's in the middle of
a switching process, or because it is used in linear amplifier service.
Switching MOSFETs placed in parallel are usually fitted with
independent series resistors at their gates, which assures adequate
sharing of the switching load. But in linear service this doesn't work
well enough.</p>




<p>While a MOSFET is&nbsp;in its linear range, its ON
resistance (the one that has the convenient positive temperature
coefficient) is irrelevant. Instead the current is controlled by the
device's transconductance. And unfortunately in many MOSFETs the
temperature variation of the transconductance plays against us, over
most of the device's current range, and usually over ALL of the range
in which it will ever be used while in linear service! In practice this
not only means that switching MOSFETs running in parallel while in
linear service will have severe load sharing problems, but also that
a&nbsp;single switching MOSFET run in linear service can have load
sharing problems across its surface, leading to hotspotting and
destruction!</p>




<p>For this reason, MOSFETs designed for linear service
(regardless of whether it's DC, audio or RF) need to have an internally
ballasted construction. That means, there must be enough resistance
built in, distributed across the device's surface, to evenly spread out
the current. </p>




<p> Unfortunately MOSFETs for linear service&nbsp;have a very
small market, compared to that for switching MOSFETs. As a consequence,
there are few linear MOSFETs available, and they are way more expensive
than their switching cousins.</p>




<p>Another difference is in the encapsulation. RF MOSFETs come
in&nbsp;packages that have very low lead inductance, specially for
the source leads. Normal power switching MOSFETs instead
come&nbsp;in plain conventional packages, that have much higher
inductances. Also with RF MOSFETs it's almost a rule that the device
either has internal insulation from the heatsink mounting surface, or
has the source connected to the mounting surface, while with
switching&nbsp;MOSFETs that's rather an exception, with the usual
configuration being the drain connected to the mounting surface. But
internal insulation is very useful in RF applications, almost essential
in some cases.</p>




<p>So, can switching type MOSFETs be used in RF linear amplifers?
Or rather, does it make sense to even consider using them?</p>




<p>Simple answer: An MRF154 costs 450 dollars. A switching MOSFET
having the same power dissipation capability, with better voltage and
current ratings, costs 15 dollars. There ought to be a way to make it
work, don't you think?<br>




</p>




<p>Let's look at some basic specs for some transistors. First, I
would like to compare the&nbsp;MRF157 linear RF MOSFET o
the&nbsp;IXFX180N25T switching MOSFET. I chose the MRF157 simply
because it's well known and available, and the other one I chose
without much thinking or any selecting, looking for one that would have
about the same power dissipation and have a balanced set of other
features.</p>

<p> This table makes switching transistors like this Ixys very,
very appealing! Don't you think? At essentially the same power
dissipation capability, it can work at twice the voltage, almost three
times the current, has almost six times better&nbsp;ON resistance,
more than six times higher transconductance (gain), only slightly
higher input capacitance (which is far outweighted by the higher
transconductance requiring a lower drive
voltage),&nbsp;far&nbsp;lower output&nbsp;and reverse
transfer capacitances, and it costs&nbsp;27 times less money! For
these big advantages one could accept the less than optimal casing,
right?</p>




<p>But we have to look deeper than just these basic specs. First,
the
problem with the case.&nbsp;An RF transistor like the MRF157 can be
bolted&nbsp;directly to the heatsink, and the connections are
brought
out to broad&nbsp;strips. That results in only a few nanohenries of
total stray inductance. The switching transistor instead is housed in a
plastic package having leads, that internally connect to the silicon
chip by probably only a few bonding wires. The stray inductance could
easily be 10 times higher than for the RF transistor case.
If&nbsp;we
run the transistor from an&nbsp;80V&nbsp;supply, then the peak
current
will around 50A. If we happen to get 13 nH in the source lead, as
suggested by some data sheets,&nbsp; then on the 10 meter band we
get
an inductive&nbsp;reactance of about 2.4 Ohm. So
the&nbsp;source lead
will cause a voltage drop of 120V peak! Clearly, this
cannot&nbsp;work
at all! Even just 3nH of stray inductance in the source lead would
still be too much! The MRF157 instead, using its mounting surface as
source connection, probably has a source inductance of less than 1 nH,
so it doesn't have too bad problems in this area, as long as the
circuit layout and construction is good.</p>




<p> Also, look that this switching transistor has the drain
connected to the heat sink. Unless you use a pretty complicate circuit
to place the drains at ground level, you will either need an
electrically&nbsp;floating heat sink, which is problematic at RF,
or you need to insulate the transistor from the heat sink. If you do
so, the additional thermal resistance will&nbsp;limit this
transistor to a much lower power dissipation than the MRF157 can work
at.</p>




<p>So, the silly leaded plastic package seems to be
the&nbsp;Achilles heel of this otherwise nice transistor!</p>




<p>But not only. We have to look at the other specs, and then
figure out some things. First some good news: According to the data
sheet, this switching transistor's transconductance decreases with
temperature. That's nice, because it should make this transistor
operate&nbsp;in linear mode without hotspotting! </p>




<p>But would that really work well? Its transconductance is very
high. You would need less than half a volt of RF at the gate to fully
drive this transistor. At such high gain, it's likely that the
linearity will be pretty poor. That means heavy splatter all over the
band and beyond! It might be possible to linearize the amplifier well
enough by using negative feedback, but probably not as easily as it is
with transistors designed for linear service. And keeping the idling
current constant enough, when the transconductance is that high, is
another problem on its own!</p>




<p>Other doubts arise regarding the propagation time along the
gate structure. MOSFETs that were not designed for RF use might simply
be too slow in this regard. So one end of the MOSFET chip might already
be finishing conduction, while the other end is just about starting it!
The transistor will be working out of step with itself if that happens.
Maybe it doesn't happen, but when a transistor isn't specified for the
kind of service one will put it in, one can only guess, hope, try and
see!</p>




<p>Anyway, with the problems of the leaded plastic case, using
this transistor for high power RF is a lost cause, so we don't need to
even test it.</p>




<p>Does this mean that we cannot use switching transistors at all
for RF linear amplifiers? Well, not necessarily! Two ideas come to
mind, which can alleviate the problem of excessive lead inductance.</p>




<p> First is using the highest possible supply voltage, along
with high voltage MOSFETs. This will reduce the current, and thus the
voltage drop over the source lead inductance, which is essentially
fixed for a given type of encapsulation. The other technique is using
many small MOSFETs instead of a few large ones. Smaller cases have
lower inductances, and more devices in parallel have far lower total
combined inductance! Also this paralleling of many devices eases the
thermal management. It's far easier to adequately cool many small
devices dissipating a small amount of power each, than cooling just two
somewhat bigger devices which&nbsp;produce as much&nbsp;heat
as&nbsp;the kitchen range!</p>




<p>On the other hand, paralleling MOSFETs introduces problems of
load sharing, and phase alignment between them. I do not particularly
like to use 32 small MOSFETs in 16&nbsp;separate push-pull
amplifier modules, and then interconnect them using splitters,
combiners, and a ratsnest of coax cables of matched lengths. It works,
but it's not elegant, and too expensive. Instead I'm looking for a way
to build a single push-pull stage, with many small MOSFETs on each
side, that still&nbsp;works well enough. It could be by paralleling
the drains and using separate tiny ferrite loaded transformers for the
gate drive of each MOSFET, with the primaries of all of
them&nbsp;driven in parallel&nbsp;or perhaps in series. The
assembly would have to be compact, though, to avoid excessive phasing
problems, and that runs against easy heat spreading.</p>




<p>Let's look at some more switching MOSFETs in TO-247 cases,
rated at 1 kV, to see how the scenery looks for high voltage amplifiers
with many MOSFETs. I will just choose a few available devices pretty
much at random:</p>

<p>The idea is to run such transistors from the rectified and
filtered mains, at a DC voltage of roughly 310V. In real world
conditions these devices should be able to dissipate 100 to 150
watts,&nbsp;so that in a class AB amplifier each would run at a
peak current of about 2A, average of about 0.7A. Under these conditions
the source lead inductance of a TO-247 encapsulation causes only about
5V of peak voltage drop on the 10 meter band, which can be
handled&nbsp;by the drive circuit. The ON resistance is good to,
and would cause very little loss under these
conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>




<p>But this is about where the beauty ends: Just look at the
capacitances! Even taking the best of these three in this regard, we
still get 25pF of reverse transfer capacitance. In a legal limit
amplifier, we would need about six of these devices in parallel on each
side. That makes 150pF of reverse transfer capacitance on each side.
With a 600V swing on the drains, and this capacitance, Miller effect is
a show killer! We are talking about six amperes of unwanted 90-degree
phase shifted feedback current getting into the gates via the reverse
transfer capacitance! Even if we make a drive circuit&nbsp;adapted
to handle this, it's likely that the gate structures and connections
won't like it very much. And the output capacitances are so high that
we would end up with about 40 or more amperes of reactive RF current
flowing in them! There is no way in the world to handle this in a
broadband circuit. It would require a tuned tank circuit with a Q
factor above 8 or so, much like in tube-based amplifiers.</p>




<p>Clearly this won't work.</p>




<p>Note how higher capacitance go hand in hand with lower ON
resistance and higher transconductance. This is typical. For RF use
we&nbsp;should look at MOSFETs having the lowest possible
capacitances, transconductance, and thus the highest ON resistances in
their class. For low frequency switching applications instead one would
typically look mostly at getting the lowest&nbsp;ON resistance.</p>




<p>Let's compare to a high voltage RF&nbsp;MOSFET:&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can see, the main difference is marked by lower input
and output capacitances, higher ON resistance, and lower
transconductance, all of these indicating a lighter gate structure in
the RF transistor. The much higher reverse transfer capacitance is an
anomaly. I wonder if these values simply arose from&nbsp;different
testing methodology used for these two transistors, causing the IX
transistor to show less reverse transfer capacitance in exchange for
very high input capacitance. </p>




<p>And of course the other very important difference&nbsp;is
the&nbsp;encapsulation. The switching transistor comes in a leaded
plastic case with no insulation, while the RF transistor comes in an
insulated ceramic case with stripline terminals. Whether the case is
made of plastic or ceramic is not such a dramatic difference, but the
internal insulation and the stripline terminals both make a huge
difference. In practical terms, the ARF might be able to dissipate 700
or 800 watts in real world conditions, while the IX wil be limited to
maybe 150 watts after adding the required insulation! And the low
inductance stripline terminals allow the RF transistor to have a low
voltage drop at high RF current which is far better than what the
switching transistor could ever achieve. </p>




<p> It seems clear that for RF amplifiers we should use
transistors made for that application, and not press switching
transistors into that service. The problem is just that RF transistors
are&nbsp;much more expensive, and often hard to get. When I asked a
somewhat obscure distributor for a quotation, he asked how many
thousand transistors&nbsp;I would purchase per month. When I said I
needed just a few&nbsp;of them, one time only, he never again
replied. The switching transistors instead can be ordered
from&nbsp;many&nbsp;places, hassle-free, even in small
quantities.</p>




<p>Do you like my comparison tables? Let's see one more,
comparing three generations of RF power MOSFETs. One from Motorola
dating to the 1970s, a much newer one from APT (now Microsemi), and the
even newer one from IxysRF:</p>

<p>The MRF needs to be powered from about 50V, while the ARF can
run from anything between 50 and about 120V, having wide tolerance
margins. The Ixys is much smaller - about three or four of these would
make up one of the ARF or MRF, but with better capacitance ratings,
lower price and better heat spreading - and higher complexity,
unfortunately.</p>




<p>Pricewise, clearly the old MRF is too expensive to be
worth&nbsp;considering.&nbsp;The ARF is better, but still
expensive. The price stated for the Ixys is a bit of hearsay, since the
distributor stating that price is out of stock and can't supply them,
but if it is true, four of these Ixys transistors would be an
attractive alternative to one&nbsp;<br>

of the others.</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Update (2016): &nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;">In
recent years a variety of high power LDMOSFETs have become available,
some of these offering output power levels well in excess of 1kW from a
single Gemini device. These transistors tend to have extremely good
capabilities at higher frequencies, so much so that devices intended
purely for HF use are scarce, while most extend their operational range
at least to VHF, if not UHF. These LDMOSFETs can be used to make high
power conventional class AB amplifiers, at a device cost well below
that of the older generation of FETs. The difficulties are mainly
related to cooling. If a thermal power close to a kilowatt needs to be
extracted from a device measuring 13cm, which needs to be kept below
60C or so if we want to keep the silicon inside below 200C and
survive, then we are facing a formidable thermal design task! </span><br>

<br style="font-style: italic;">

<span style="font-style: italic;">Other trouble with these UHF
transistors is their tendency to self-oscillate. Somebody developing an
HF amplifier might not even notice an instability at 500MHz! But it can
cause severe interference, or kill the transistors.</span><br>

<br style="font-style: italic;">

<span style="font-style: italic;">At the same time, better switching
transistors are becoming available, driven by the relentless push for
higher switching frequencies in power supplies. There are now
inexpensive TO-220 cased MOSFETs that will readily operate to 30MHz in
broadband circuits, and to at least 60MHz in tuned ones. In the years
since writing this article, I have made experiments with several such
MOSFETs.&nbsp; So far the best performer I tried is the IXTP1R6N50P. At
a cost of slightly above $1, it can be used at 30 to 40W output power
per device, with good performance through 22MHz, and acceptable at
30MHz. The AOT3N50 is even cheaper and provides more power per device,
but only to 15MHz or so.&nbsp; Arno Weidemann, DL9AH, published a high
power amplifier using the older IRF710 MOSFETs, which are in the same
voltage, current and power class as these. I tried them too, and they
do work acceptably, but the IXTP1R6N50P is superior. Newer and further
improved MOSFETs are showing up frequently. In any case, the rule for
this kind of amplifiers is: Use many low power, mid/high voltage FETs
in parallel, instead of a smaller number of larger devices.</span>&nbsp;<br style="font-style: italic;">

<br>

 A basic question is what supply voltage to use. The old
tradition of the 1970's, apparently established by Motorola, is 50V.
That requires a power supply capable of delivering 60A, and results in
a drain-to-drain load resistance of only 3 Ohm, with all the resulting
problems. Some newer MOSFETs are designed to work from 50V
up,&nbsp;through 80V, 100V, and sometimes more, all the way to
about 300V. This generally simplifies&nbsp;the power supply and the
impedance matching, as long as the output capacitance doesn't get in
the way. Data sheets, application notes, and comments from people who
have tried, suggest that high supply voltages are troublesome if the
amplifier has to work in linear mode. It's very hard to get reliable,
intelligent information about these problems. It seems that modern
MOSFETs are fine for 80V or so, maybe 100V, but not much higher, in
linear RF service. This already results in much more comfortable
impedances, but we still require a fully fledged power supply, either
using a big, heavy, expensive transformer, or using rather high power
switching components. A linear amplifier powered straight from the
rectified and filtered&nbsp;mains seems to be an elusive goal.
Countries using 117V power lines have much better chances in this
regard than those using 230V, even if powering a legal limit amplifier
from a 117V line poses some problems of its own. Running an amplifier
based on a pair of ARF1505 straight from 310V DC might be problematic
in many ways, only one of&nbsp;the problems&nbsp;being the
output capacitance of 300pF, which at 30MHz has a reactance almost 4
times lower than the load resistance. That would be hard or impossible
to handle with a true broadband circuit, requiring instead some sort of
resonant band-switched circuit.


<p> &nbsp;</p>




<h2>Is this&nbsp;an amplifier or a stove?&nbsp;</h2>




<p>Why are hams still willing to use power amplifiers that have
an efficiency lower than 50%? Broadcasters have long ago
stopped&nbsp;using them! A broadcast transmitter that doesn't have
at least 80% efficiency has no market chances anymore, and many exceed
90% efficiency. Energy is simply too expensive to waste it in heat
while producing an RF signal! It's high time that hams would follow
this trend. We should be <strong>leaders</strong> in radio
technology, not late adopters, let alone naysayers!</p>




<p> A high efficiency amplifier would have many advantages:
Smaller, lighter, possibly cheaper, lower energy consumption, longer
component lifespan and reliability, lower or no fan noise, among
others. And if the amplifier uses a switching scheme instead of
conventional linear amplification, switching type RF MOSFETs can be
used, which are more plentiful and less expensive than linear types,
while at the same time all concerns about IMD and linearity move out of
the amplifier block proper, and into the control circuit, which works
at&nbsp;low power and so is far easier to
manage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;I'm very fond of the idea of making a highly
efficient legal limit amplifier for the HF bands. Of course it's quite
a bit more difficult to make a broadband 1.8-30 MHz linear amplifier
for SSB in switching technology, than it is to make a switching AM
transmitter for the 0.5-1.6 MHz broadcast band, or even for the
shortwave broadcast bands. Both require amplitude linearity, but in
addition the SSB amp requires phase linearity, and the
frequency&nbsp;is higher.</p>




<h2>Modulating the power supply</h2>




<p>A relatively simple way of improving the efficiency of an
amplifier is to modulate the power supply so that the amplifier gets
just enough voltage&nbsp;for the power level it has to produce at
any given instant. A good class AB amplifier is capable of producing
about 65% efficiency at full power, but this decays all the way to
zero, as the power level is lowered! So, a&nbsp;basic conventional
class AB amplifier will have an overall efficiency of maybe between 20
and 45%, depending on the type of&nbsp;modulation, compression
level, and so on. If we control the supply voltage, the amplifier could
run at 100% of its possible output power (at the given supply voltage) <strong>all
the time!</strong> That would allow to get a 65% overall
efficiency, saving about half of the heat produced.</p>




<p>To do this, all that's needed is to power the amplifier from a
switching power supply that&nbsp;can accept fast enough modulation,
and one has to provide some sort of detector that produces
the&nbsp;modulation signal. </p>




<p>The power supply needs to have a certain minimum voltage set,
because MOSFETs sharply increase their capacitances when the voltage
gets very low, and that would seriously impair&nbsp;linearity. But
still, a class AB amplifier that has a switching power supply could be
improved at very low additional cost, by adding this supply voltage
modulation. The&nbsp;improvement in efficiency is not dramatic
enough to do away with heatsinks and fans, but it's enough to warrant
the small additional complexity. The savings in transistor ratings and
heatsinking will probably pay for the additional circuitry, with some
surplus, and the energy savings will be a freeby.</p>




<h2>Envelope elimination and
restoration&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>




<p>It is possible to split the driving signal into phase and
amplitude components, amplify each separately, and recombine them at
the output. In practice this looks like putting an amplitude detector
at the input and using its output to modulate the power supply, while
at the same time squaring up the drive signal and use it to drive a
high efficiency, switching type amplifier, typically in class E or
class F to achieve an efficiency beyond 90%. The output amplitude of
this amplifier will follow the supply voltage, and the phase will be
that of the driving signal. We get linear amplification with an overall
efficiency (mains connector to RF out connector) of close to 80%. It
almost looks too good to be true - and indeed there are serious
problems in this approach!</p>




<p>One problem is that the RF signal path through the amplifier,
and the modulation path through the switching power supply, typically
have very different delay times. But at the output they need to arrive
at the same time! So, some delaying of the RF signal is needed.</p>




<p>Worse is the problem caused by the capacitances within the
MOSFETs. They are pretty large, and they change drastically when the
supply voltage gets low. In low amplitude places of the waveform the
power supply voltage gets very low, and the capacitances can get ten
times as high as at normal voltages. Not only does this detune the
output network, but also it totally wrecks the phase response! At low
amplitude levels, the drive signal feedthrough gets larger than the
amplified signal - and the drive signal has opposite phase! This is in
addition to the phase modulation caused directly by the changing
capacitances.</p>




<p>In 2006 I built a small scale model of such an amplifier. I
believe more in practical experiment than in mathematical analysis,
specially because I'm more handy with the soldering iron and the
oscilloscope, than with advanced mathematics and MathCAD. The results I
got were beautifully high efficiency, using common switching MOSFETs on
80 and 40 meters, but the linearity when transmitting voice in SSB was
poor. The third order IMD products were down just&nbsp;18dB, and
that was the best I ever got. That level of splatter is ideally suited
for hams who want to make instant enemies on any band they fancy to
pollute.</p>




<p>One way to reduce this problem is to run the amplifier in EER
mode only for the higher amplitude levels. For the lower amplitude
parts of the signal, the power supply voltage would be clamped to a
fixed value, high enough to avoid the worst phase shifting effects,
and&nbsp;bias the amplifier into class AB. Saulo Quaggio, PY2KO,
built such an amplifier and published it (QEX, July/August 2006). But
he used tubes, avoiding the changing capacitances of MOSFETs! Even so,
he operates his amplifier in class AB at low levels, and class F with
EER only at the higher levels.</p>




<p>Using MOSFETs, it should be possible to run such an amplifier
in pure EER high efficiency mode, by&nbsp;modulating both the final
stage and at least the driver to it, to avoid feedthrough of drive
power, and then using configurable and programmable predistortion of
the phase information, most likely using digital signal processing. But
this approach&nbsp;is far too complex to use in a simple,
inexpensive, homebrew ham radio linear amplifier, and anyway it is
better suited to a self-contained transmitter than to an add-on
amplifier.</p>




<p>At this time, I don't see how to come up with a&nbsp; good
implementation of EER for a&nbsp;ham radio linear amplifier, where
the word "good" stands for "simple, inexpensive, with adequate
performance".</p>




<h2>Pulse width modulation</h2>




<p>So I have changed my aproach to an efficient amplifier: My
concept now revolves around pulse width modulation. But not in the way
audio PWM amplifiers are made, which use a high frequency carrier
signal onto which the audio is pulse-width-modulated, and then a simple
low pass filter at the&nbsp;output that passes the audio but
rejects the&nbsp;carrier. With audio you can do that, because
MOSFETS can very easily switch at the frequencies no higher than 1MHz
required by this approach. With an HF amplifier instead, the MOSFETs
would have to switch efficiently <strong>at least</strong>
in the high VHF range, and that's a lot to ask. So my concept instead
has the MOSFETs switch at the actual transmitting
frequency.&nbsp;For this to work in SSB, it has to be done
preserving the phase modulation that is present on the drive signal,
and without introducing any additional phase modulation.</p>




<p>This is the&nbsp;block diagram of the amplifier I have in
mind:</p>




<p align="center"><img src="./Some thoughts on low cost, solid state, kilowatt-class HF linear amplifiers_files/fig5.gif" border="0" height="157" hspace="8" vspace="8" width="686">
</p>




<p> The input signal is passed through a limiter that generates
essentially a square wave that has the same phase as the input (except
for&nbsp;delays in the circuit). This in turn is passed through a
simple integrator, which produces a triangle wave that has its peaks at
the zero crossings of the square wave. That implies a 90 degree phase
lag, but that's not a&nbsp;problem, because the lag is
constant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>




<p>This fixed amplitude triangle wave, that follows the phase
modulation of the drive signal, is compared to an error signal,
obtained from the comparison of the output amplitude to the input
amplitude. A&nbsp;PWM signal results, the pulse lengths
being&nbsp;adjusted to get the correct&nbsp;amplitude at the
output, while&nbsp;the pulse position follows&nbsp;only the
phase&nbsp;changes of the&nbsp;drive signal. In a practical
implementation, the comparator will likely have to produce two output
signals, to drive the two sides of a power amplifier, but a
single-ended implementation is conceivable too. The&nbsp;power
stage is a simple but very fast switching circuit. The band pass filter
reconstructs the sine wave.</p>




<p>The comparator cannot use much hysteresis, because that would
result in nonlinearities at the low amplitude end, due to pulses
dropping out entirely instead of getting narrower. Without hysteresis,
it has to be a low noise comparator, to avoid as much as possible the
chance of multiple pulses per semicycle. Maybe a very tiny amount of
hysteresis could be used.</p>




<p>At very low amplitudes, it's likely that pulses will start
dropping out anyway. That creates subharmonics in the output signal,
and this is &nbsp;the reason why we need a&nbsp;bandpass filter
rather than a simple low pass filter. With the band pass filter in
place, of sufficiently high Q, and thanks to the amplitude correction
loop, linearity should remain decent even down to pretty small signals.
But as the signal continues to shrink, eventually there won't be enough
signal for the limiter to work on, and the system will fall apart.
That's no problem though, as long as it happens at an amplitude that's
so low that nobody cares - let's say, 60 or 70dB below the peak power.
This should be easy to achieve. The detailed design could&nbsp;
include a circuit that completely shuts off any output pulses below a
certain&nbsp;drive amplitude, to prevent any nonsense from
appearing at the output under such conditions.</p>




<p>The amplitude loop needs to have a bandwidth large enough to
pass all significant components of the envelope. In an SSB signal,
these extend far beyond the audio bandwidth, since the envelope looks
like a rectified audio signal, with sharp edges at the zero level. A
bandwidth of 100kHz would be my first guess, but the scheme proposed
could easily be implemented with an envelope loop bandwidth even
broader than that - several hundred kHz or so. The lowest band in which
the amplifier is supposed to operate is 1.8MHz, so that still gives
enough frequency difference to properly separate the RF signal from
envelope components.</p>




<p>The power supply to the power stage doesn't need to be
regulated, or even very well filtered. Any hum and voltage variations
will be taken care of by the amplitude loop, compensating supply
voltage variations by opposing changes in pulse width. The only
constraints for supply voltage would be to have enough voltage at all
times to be able to produce the desired&nbsp;peak amplitude, and
not so much that the MOSFET capacitances become too much of a problem.</p>




<p>All the small signal processing of this amplifier can be
easily implemented. Probably it can be done even using audio-like
methods, employing operational amplifiers! A wide range of pretty good
RF op amps are available nowadays. The problem, though, lies in the
power stage. Ideally this stage should switch very fast, compared to
the RF signal period. That calls for switching times&nbsp;near one
nanosecond, to operate well up to 30MHz! Up to a few ns might be
acceptable, at the cost of reduced efficiency on the higher bands. Very
fast&nbsp;RF switching MOSFETs are becoming available, along with
suitable driver ICs, but still it's a real problem handling the
MOSFET's capacitances when switching so fast. The bandpass filter
following the MOSFETs must absolutely be designed in such a way that it
absorbs these capacitances, and presents the proper load phase angles
to the MOSFETs to achieve efficient operation. So we are talking class
E or class F again, but with the added difficulty of having widely
variable pulse lengths, instead of a nice steady square wave, as the
source signal! I haven't analyzed this problem in depth yet, so at this
moment I don't even know whether it's posible at all to solve it, or if
some serious compromise would have to be reached. This point might well
be the Achilles heel of this whole concept.</p>




<p>It should be noted that as the pulse widths get very small at
low amplitudes, any MOSFETs selected will no longer be able to switch
fully on and off in such a&nbsp;short time. This&nbsp;is <strong>not</strong>
a problem, really. Simply the amplifier will degrade from class E or F
to unsaturated class C at low signal levels, reducing the efficiency
somewhat. But since it happens only at the lowest amplitudes, the
losses will be nearly negligible, and the loss of amplitude linearity
in the power section should be very well corrected by the amplitude
loop. The only real point to watch in this area is that we need the
MOSFETs and their drivers to stay symmetric in their switch-on and
switch-off performance! &nbsp;Otherwise a phase modulation would be
introduced&nbsp;at amplitudes low enough to prevent the MOSFETs
from fully saturating, and that would seriously degrade spectral
purity, because it will happen at a power level that is still
significant, specially on the higher bands, where the MOSFET switching
time is a more significant portion of the total signal period. This
symmetry can probably be obtained to a sufficient degree by
manipulating the MOSFET drivers, or at most it might require some bias
applied for that purpose.</p>




<p>In any amplifier that separates the phase from the amplitude
and recombines them at the output, like this one, it's important that
the delays on the two signal paths match well enough.
With&nbsp;supply-modulated EER amplifiers this is often a problem,
because the delays of the amplitude signal through a switching power
supply can be rather long. In this PWM concept, instead, the delay in
the amplitude loop is much shorter. Maybe it doesn't even need to be
compensated for, and if it does, that could be done using a rather
modest delay line in the RF path.</p>

<p></p>




<h2>Linear class C
</h2>

Most people associate class C with "nonlinear, FM only" amplifiers. But
MOSFET class-C amplifiers can be pretty well linearized by properly
modulating the bias! The bias voltage would most likely come from a circuit
comparing the output amplitude to the input amplitude. At idle
condition, the bias voltage would be set for a very low idling current.
With tiny signals the amplifier would operate in class A, but as the
drive signal grows, it would move into class AB and on into class C, as
the bias control circuit reduces the bias to keep the output
proportional to the input despite the higher gain of FETs at higher
signal levels. As the drive nears maximum, and the amplifier is driven
into saturation, reducing its gain, the control circuit would
compensate for that by increasing the bias again, so that at full
output the amplifier operates in saturated class C, near saturated
class B.<br>

<br>

The feedback circuit needs to have a relatively large bandwidth, to
cleanly process SSB signals. For AM signals this requirement is far
less stringent.&nbsp; <br>

<h2>And a class ACE amplifier!</h2>

This is my latest pet idea, as of 2016. &nbsp;It's the same idea
expressed above, but designing the power stage as a class E amplifier.
It would operate in class E at full power, going through class C over
much of the dynamic range, entering class AB at low levels and class A
at very low ones. Since "class AABCE" is too long, I love the idea of
calling this a "class ACE" amplifier!<br>

<br>

This circuit can be developed around cheap switching MOSFETs, which
work particularly well in class E circuits. Their large gate voltage
range is very welcome, given that the gates need to survive the drive
voltage plus the bias modulation, a condition that might carry
LDMOSFETs out of their very limited safe gate voltage range. <br>

<br>

Class E amplifiers can't be broadband.&nbsp; A ham amplifier would
either need a bandswitched, tuned output network, not unlike an
old-fashioned tube amplifier,<br>

or one class-E output network per band, switched&nbsp;by relays. The
latter isn't at all too exotic, if you consider that present-day class
AB solid state amplifiers anyway need a bank of relay-switched low-pass
filters! Just replace the filters by class-E networks, and you are
done! &nbsp;But note that this cannot be done easily enough when a high
power amplifier is built around 50V devices, because the resulting
drain impedance is far too low to be&nbsp;switched by relays. Instead
by using plain cheap higher voltage MOSFETs, the drain impedance comes
into a range that makes relay switching perfectly possible. &nbsp; <br>




<hr>
<br>

<br>

<h2>High efficiency, or conventional?</h2>







<p>Reading about such&nbsp;complex concepts, you might ask why not
simply continue building conventional, class AB linear amplifiers, and
just put up with their low efficiency. And in fact, almost all (or
perhaps all!) amateur radio equipment manufacturers are doing exactly
that. The ham community by and large apparently doesn't care about
efficiency, power saving, and the like. There are even some retrograde
hams who judge the quality of any equipment by its weight - the
heavier, the better they think it is! So, why bother?</p>




<p>I will give you some true reasons why high efficiency
amplifiers are a worthwhile goal. No, reducing
your&nbsp;electricity bill really isn't the driving reason, as the
savings will be quite small, except perhaps for really adept
ragchewers.&nbsp;The reasons are rather like these:</p>




<p>- <strong>Cost</strong>: A high efficiency
amplifier produces very little heat. That means using fewer MOSFETs,
saving cost. Also the heatsink and fans will be much smaller, and thus
less costly. The same goes for all power supply components. Unregulated
power supplies can be used with some of these strategies, further reducing cost. The&nbsp;box
will be smaller - less money spent on it. At the same time, the
additional parts needed&nbsp;for the rather extensive signal
processing as compared to a conventional amplifier, cost very little,
because these are all small signal parts. In the case of the PWM amplifier, the whole pack of two
envelope detectors, error amplifier, limiter, integrator, and pulse
width modulator, might fit easily on less than 10cm of printed
circuit board, and cost just&nbsp;10 dollars in parts. The power
stage, too,&nbsp;is simpler than a class AB one, not requiring
negative feedback, for example, nor gain compensation. The only more
expensive section in the PWM amplifier, compared to a conventional one,
is the bank of bandpass filters, where a conventional amplifier
only requires&nbsp;lowpass ones.</p>




<p>- <strong>Size</strong>: As hinted above, such a
high efficiency amplifier would be much smaller and lighter than a
conventional one. That's a big bonus on DXpeditions, but also for
elderly hams who can't very well lift a 35kg amplifier onto the bench!</p>




<p>- <strong>Stability</strong>: A switching
amplifier has no issues with bias stability, because it uses no
quiescent current. Conventional solid state amplifiers require lots of
attention to this point.</p>




<p>- <strong>Parallelability</strong>: Should it be
necessary to use several MOSFETs to achieve the desired power, in a switchmode amplifier they can
most likely be connected in parallel, without taking any special measures. Conventional amplifiers instead
typically require building several identical amplifier blocks,
and&nbsp;join them through splitters and combiners, because
otherwise it's just about impossible to get&nbsp;MOSFETs to
properly share the load&nbsp;under all conditions when operating in
linear mode.</p>




<p>&nbsp;And the advantages for conventinal class AB MOSFET
amplifiers? They have some too, of course: Every child can take a
schematic from an application note, developed by someone else and
time-proven, buy the parts (as long as it's a rich child!)&nbsp;and
assemble it. No brain&nbsp;effort is needed, and the results are
pretty much guaranteed, as&nbsp;amplifiers have been built to the
same designs for&nbsp;over 40 years. &nbsp;It's even
possible to buy kits that have all the parts, buy the PCBs, anything.
You can even buy the complete amplifiers. It's easy. But expensive, and
in my opinion, rather boring.</p>




<p>Do you remember the Radio Amateur's Code? Part 3 of it says
"The Radio Amateur is PROGRESSIVE... with knowledge abreast of science,
a well-built and <em>efficient</em>
station..."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>




<p>Where does a high power class AB amplifier fit in there?</p>
