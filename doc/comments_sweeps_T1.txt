VNA Sweeps

VNA SWR Sweep of PennyWhistle - done with miniVNA Pro.
(For these sweeps, specifically, I was following the instructions in the assembly manual:
(If you are concerned about your proper assembly of transformer T1, an easy check is to connect an antenna analyzer, such as an MFJ-259 into the input connector (powered off) and you should see a VSWR below 1.5 from 1.8 MHz to 50 MHz, dipping down to 1.2 or lower around 10 MHz.)

Here are the files: - zip file of Excel Spreadsheet, uncompressed Excel Spreadsheet, PDF file of Excel Spreadsheet.
(Contact AJ6BC if you'd like to see this in another file format.)
